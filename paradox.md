Automated translation was expected to increase productivity and create more demand for services. However, there is a downturn. This year, many translation companies have reported lower revenues, and some in-house localization teams have been downsized or eliminated. Below are some public examples from Language Service Providers (LSPs) showing this trend.

## Examples of Decline

- **RWS** reported a 10% decrease in sales in regulated industries like legal, life sciences, and patent translation (RWS FY24 Results).
- **Straker** showed an 11% drop in revenue, even though it is a leader in technology disruption. Gains from AI workflows and new clients have not yet made up for losses in traditional business lines (Straker FY25 Interim Results).
- **Honyaku Center** in Japan reported no growth in its core translation business, but interpretation services grew (Honyaku Center Highlights).
- At **TAUS Albuquerque**, Marco Trombetti noted that Translated grew by 29% thanks to AI enterprise business, but demand from small and medium businesses remained flat.
- **Arle Lommel** from CSA Research found that traditional translation sales dropped 16.3% over five years, and post-editing has not fully compensated for this loss (CSA Research).

While these examples are from large companies, smaller, traditional businesses are feeling the decline more. Surveys from Nimdzi, Slator, and CSA confirm the extent of the gap. The signs are clear, and current evidence points to a concerning trend.

Even though machine translation (MT) allows more content to be translated at lower costs, the expected surge in demand has not happened. Why?

## Jevon's Paradox

In the 19th century, James Watt improved the steam engine, making it more efficient. Coal magnates feared their businesses would shrink because less fuel would be needed. But the opposite happened. More efficient engines allowed factories and transport vehicles to do more with less coal, leading to greater demand for coal and starting the Industrial Revolution.

This phenomenon is called **Jevon’s Paradox**. It occurs when demand grows faster than cost reduction. In translation, if AI reduces costs by 30%, demand would need to increase by 60% to see similar growth. Konstantin Savenkov predicted that MT would lead to massive growth in global translation volume, but this has not yet happened.

## The World Needs More Translation

Machine translation has the potential to transform the industry. We are more connected than ever, but there are not enough human translators to handle every conversation, phone call, website visit, or interaction in different languages. MT makes these interactions possible.

In business, the localization sector still has room for growth. Many global companies translate only a small part of their content. For example, in 2024, **John Yunker** found that the top 25 globalized websites supported an average of 58 languages (Byte Level Research). However, CSA estimates that only 20-30% of online content is translated when a language is supported.

Ideally, all websites, textbooks, and apps would be available in every language. So why are many translation companies struggling?

## Reasons for the Decline

### 1. Document Translation Shifted to Apps

Demand for traditional document translation in sectors like legal and public services is decreasing as consumers turn to tools like ChatGPT and DeepL. Examples include:

- **Legal Offices**: Many now use MT for quick translations, bypassing agencies.
- **Public Sector**: Governments, like the EU and Minnesota, are using MT in their systems.

Exceptions exist, especially in life sciences, where high stakes prevent reliance on MT.

### 2. Cost-Cutting in Enterprise Localization

In-house localization teams often struggle to show that translation brings a direct return on investment (ROI). Successful teams have optimized workflows using technology to reduce costs, but the savings are often redirected to other departments like marketing or engineering.

### 3. Translation as a Feature

Automated translation in enterprises is growing quickly, as seen with companies like **DeepL**, **Lilt**, **ModernMT**, **Smartling**, and **WeGlot**. Also, product owners and developers in digital companies are more interested in MT, leading to the "Translation as a Feature" trend.

Some examples:

- **Reddit** added French AI translation sitewide, increasing revenue by 48% and unique users by 37%.
- **Coursera** launched an AI translation project in January 2024, translating 4,200 lectures into 21 languages.
- **Oracle** introduced an AI-powered translation feature in its pharmacovigilance product **Argus**.
- **Roblox** added AI translation for player chat, game text, and documentation, increasing engagement by 6%.
- **Canva** added **Canva Translate** for multilingual designs, with 60% of its 175 million active users being international.

As MT becomes a regular feature on platforms, decision-makers may see less need for manual translation processes, leading to cost savings.

## Consequences

Automated translation is here to stay. For translation teams to adapt and trigger Jevon’s Paradox, they must convince buyers to maintain human oversight and invest in more languages.

As things stand, we will continue to see certain segments of the translation market shrink, especially affecting small businesses and cost-sensitive clients. In-house teams will spend less on services and technology, and vendors will focus more on marketing and product services. Translation companies may diversify into interpreting, content creation, and design.

I hope upcoming industry research will examine this trend more deeply and provide forecasts for 2025. In the 2000s, there were over 2,000 significant translation agencies and 50,000-100,000 micro-businesses. Today, fewer tools and platforms dominate in every category, with fewer than 10 reaching prominence. How many translation companies will survive when the market consolidates?
